1. Create the YoutubeForm component and render the child components for each form field:
  - Create the YoutubeForm component with the initial state variables for the URL, video title, description, and tags using the useState() hook.
  - Create child components for each form field (UrlInput, TitleInput, DescriptionInput, TagsInput).
  - Render the child components within the YoutubeForm component.

2. Implement onChange event handlers to update the state of the form fields:
  - Create onChange event handlers for each input field in their respective child components.
  - Update the state variables in the YoutubeForm component using the setXXX() functions returned by the useState() hook.

3. Implement form validation and error handling:
  - Create validation functions that check if the form fields are valid.
  - Display error messages if the form fields are not valid.
  - Create state variables for the error messages and display them using conditional rendering in the respective child components.

4. Implement form submission logic:
  - Create a submit handler function in the YoutubeForm component that is called when the user submits the form.
  - Validate the form fields and handle the submission, such as sending a POST request to the server.

5. Add styling and UX improvements:
  - Add styles to make the form look visually appealing.
  - Add user feedback for form validation and submission, such as success or error messages.
